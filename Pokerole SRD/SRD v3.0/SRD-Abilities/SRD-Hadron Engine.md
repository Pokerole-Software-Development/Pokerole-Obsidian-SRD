Description: This Pokemon's body is able to accelerate particles and transform them
  into energy. Theory is that it's simply bringing forward energy from another universe.
Effect: When this Pokemon comes out, it automatically starts the effects of the Move
  Electric Terrain. (In the case of a stalemate the Pokemon with higher Will might
  keep the dominant Terrain). While Electric Terrain is active, increase this Pokemon's
  Special Attribute by 2.
