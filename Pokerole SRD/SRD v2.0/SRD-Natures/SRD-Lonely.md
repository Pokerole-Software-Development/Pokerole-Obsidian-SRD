Confidence: 5
Description: They like to keep their distance and do everything on their own. They
  often feel it's up to them and nobody else to get things done and will take the
  burden of a responsibility that should be shared. Interacting with others is like
  a chore for them but being isolate also makes them feel misunderstood. They are
  hard to get close to but they can be trusted to do their best even if there's no
  one to guide them.
Keywords: Independent, Introspective, Solitary
Name: Lonely
Nature: Lonely (5)
