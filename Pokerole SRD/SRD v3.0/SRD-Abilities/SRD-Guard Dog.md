Description: A territorial and protective Pokemon. It won't ever back down or run
  away, not even from the most intimidating foes. Very loyal but can also be a bit
  scary.
Effect: If a foe uses a Move, Ability or Item to reduce this Pokemon's Strength Attribute,
  negate that effect and increase it by 2 instead. This Pokemon is immune to the effect
  of Switcher Moves that would remove it from battle.
Name: Guard Dog
