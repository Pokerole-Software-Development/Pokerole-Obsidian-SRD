Confidence: 7
Description: The world is full of wonder; there is always something new to discover
  and many others to befriend. A Naive nature is a curious and innocent nature, they
  easily trust others because they ignore the many dan- gers of the world. They still
  have a lot to learn but they take life as it comes. They rarely stress out due to
  the fact they still don't know there are many things to stress about. A friend's
  smile and a hand to take it's all they need.
