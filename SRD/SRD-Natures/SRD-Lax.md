Confidence: 8
Description: Lax is an inconstant nature, those under it will do things whenever they
  feel like it.   Is not that they are lazy, they just don't see the need to waste
  energy on stuff that's not important for them yet. Since they don't care to fill
  anyone's expectations they rarely stress out about social norms, but they'll need
  a reason to keep motivated and an even better reason to be pro-active instead of
  indifferent.
Keywords: Unconcerned, Indolent, Simple
Name: Lax
Nature: Lax (8)
