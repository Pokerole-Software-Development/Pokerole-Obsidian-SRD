Confidence: 6
Description: Why should they listen to you? You are not their boss! Most of the time
  they'll deliberately do the opposite from what's expected from them. Why? Because
  they can, of course. They love to see others get mad and will use their clever mind
  and cunning to get away with their misdeeds. When they stress they put a cool facade,
  don't let that fool you. They need to be coaxed or put in their place to behave
  properly.
Keywords: Devious, Rebel, Sly
Name: Naughty
Nature: Naughty (6)
