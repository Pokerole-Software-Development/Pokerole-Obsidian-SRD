Description: They have an attitude, and those who take themselves too seriously may
  dislike it, but the Sassy natured are simply not afraid to voice their honest opinion
  and will always find ways to speak their mind and it's always brutally honest, so
  be ready for some burns. There are no middle grounds with them, they either love
  or hate something so they can be infuriatingly difficult or surprisingly easy to
  deal with, that is part of their charm.
Keywords: Lively, Irreverent, Mouthy
