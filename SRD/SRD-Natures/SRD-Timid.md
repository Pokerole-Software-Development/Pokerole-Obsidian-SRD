Description: They have built walls around themselves that make it hard for others
  to see what's inside. They just want to be accepted but tend to worry too much and
  be way too harsh on themselves. Their confidence is usually placed on a leader figure
  and this makes them eager to please but also terrified to fail. They need to learn
  to trust in their own capabilities to reach their full potential.
