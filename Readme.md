# Pokerole Obsidian SRD

*Tldr:* This is a System Reference Document (SRD) for Pokerole 2.0. 

[Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Index) is a note taking application with a wide variety of community plugins and features markdown notes with wiki style document linking. If you've never used Markdown before, Obsidian has [a guide on the syntax here.](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes)

[Pokerole](https://www.pokeroleproject.com/) is a Pokemon tabletop roleplaying game. The books are available on the linked homepage and the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/95DFpdMVcC) is also available to answer questions about the system. 

## Right, But What is This?

A System Reference Document is a reference for a roleplaying game's mechanics. Given Pokerole supports the entire Pokedex, there's a lot of content to be searched and referenced and this vault makes doing so easier. 

The document is divided into the following sections: *Abilities, Learnsets, Moves, and Pokedex*. The content of each should be self explanatory. Two additional SRD folders exist, *Home and Sprites* which contain Pokemon Home sprites and Box Sprites respectively. 

Some highlights of the SRD's features: 

- **Links** When an SRD document references another document in the SRD, it will be rendered as a clickable link you can follow. For example, each Pokemon's abilities can be clicked on to get the details of that ability. (Tip: you can press Ctrl/Cmd over a link to open a preview!)
- **Tags** Obsidian supports adding \#tags to documents to group them. Each of the different document types in the SRD are tags according to their type. 
- **[Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)** is a very powerful query language that can be run against your notes. It can, for example, select all Pokedex entries where the Pokemon's Maximum Strength are greater than 5 and present them for you in a table. Dataview powers a large portion of the SRD, and I've included a *Dataview Queries* folder in the Vault with some sample queries. 
- **Templates** are documents you can insert into other documents with a command. You can create your own or use some of the ones I've included in the *Templates* folder.
- **Multiplatform** Obsidian can be used on any operating system, include mobile devices. You can set up your Vault to synchronize across all of those devices as well. 

I've also included a *Campaign* folder. This folder is an empty framework based off the one I use for my own Pokerole campaign.
