Description: The Pokemon surrounds itself in a vacuum. Every particle of rain, sand,
  and hail stands floating still around it, and even heat is filtered out of the place.
Effect: Negate all the effects of a Weather in the field. If no weather is active,
  they cannot be activated by Moves or Abilities. If one is already active, it does
  not disappear but provides no effects. Unique Ability.
