Confidence: 6
Description: There is an adorable shyness in them. They enjoy the simple things in
  life and are quite sensitive to other's emotions. They are very conscious about
  their own weaknesses and will try to make them better, but it hurts them to be pushed
  around and they may feel intimidated or disheartened if the challenges are too big.
  They need a strong figure who believes in them to feel confident but the fact that
  they are aware of their own weakness is a great advantage though.
Keywords: Compassionate, Vulnerable, Family Oriented
Name: Bashful
Nature: Bashful (6)
