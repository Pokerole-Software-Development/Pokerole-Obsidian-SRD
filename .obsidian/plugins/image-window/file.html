<h1 data-heading="Units">Units</h1>
<p>Every unit in the game has a Class that defines their combat stats. The Unit also has 3 slots in it's Inventory for Weapons and Items. </p>
<p>Units can be tracked on this <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mp38FUC9rSgisy39Z5EAGCNOV7AqSucRQ9OrsUStjvM/edit#gid=0" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mp38FUC9rSgisy39Z5EAGCNOV7AqSucRQ9OrsUStjvM/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Army Sheet</a> on Google Sheets. You'll need to make your own copy of the sheet to use it. </p>
<h2 data-heading="Class">Class</h2>
<p>Classes provide the following attributes. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HP</strong> Unpromoted units have 15 hit points before the Unit is defeated, Promoted unit have 20. </li>
<li><strong>Strength</strong> Strength represents the units physical and magic strength. Strength contributes mostly to Damage dealt. It also contributes to the Range of some Staves.</li>
<li><strong>Skill</strong> Skill represents a Unit's combat talent. Skill is used to determine if a Unit hits or not.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> Speed is used to determine which Unit gets to make a Follow Up attack. </li>
<li><strong>Defense</strong> Defense is a unit's physical resistance. It reduces the amount of Martial Damage the unit takes.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance</strong> Resistance is a units magical defense. It reduces the amount of Damage taken from Magic attacks. </li>
<li><strong>Wields</strong> A list of the Weapon Types a Unit can use.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> Classes can provide a Unit with tags that given them unique mechanics, defined in the Tags section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-heading="Weapons">Weapons</h2>
<p>Weapons are required for Units to attack. Weapons have the following attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damage Type</strong> Weapons do either Martial or Magic damage when used. Which type determines which of the Target's stats reduces the Damage taken from the weapon. </li>
<li><strong>Type</strong> Each Class can only use certain Weapon Types. </li>
<li><strong>Might</strong> The Damage bonus when using this weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong> A weapon's weight reduces the Unit's Speed in combat. </li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> Weapons can provide a Unit with tags that give them unique mechanics, defined in the Tags section. </li>
</ul>
<h2 data-heading="Cost">Cost</h2>
<p>Units represent hired mercenaries that are paid for each battle they fight for you. A Unit has two factors that determine how much it will cost to hire and use in a battle. </p>
<ol>
<li>Each Class has a Gold value associated with it. A Sniper will cost more than an Archer as the Archer is better trained and has better stats. (The Tags on a Class can also contribute to Gold cost for that Class.)</li>
<li>Each Weapon or Item in the Unit's Inventory when deployed will have a Gold cost as well. Similar to Classes, the combat stats and Tags a weapon provides a Unit determine how much it will cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Sum of the Class's cost and the total cost of the Inventory it's deployed with it the <strong>Unit's Cost</strong>. This cost is used when <a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="Rulebook > Armies" data-href="Rulebook#Armies" href="Rulebook#Armies" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building an Army</a> to use in a battle. </p>
<h1 data-heading="Setup">Setup</h1>
<h2 data-heading="Choose Scenario">Choose Scenario</h2>
<p>Choose a scenario from the <a data-href="Scenarios" href="Scenarios" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scenarios</a> provided or design your own. A Scenario defines a number of things about the battle you'll be playing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>War Chests</strong> both the Attacker and Defender in a scenario will have a War Chest, an amount of Gold they can build their Army with.</li>
<li><strong>Time Limits</strong> If there are a set number of Rounds for the battle, the number will be determined in the Scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Zones</strong> The specific areas of the map the Attacker and Defender are allowed to deploy their units to</li>
<li><strong>Special Requirements and Restrictions</strong> Any other things the scenario requires to be defined before the fighting begins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenarios are listed by Map they apply to, meaning they apply to decide the Map as well. </p>
<h2 data-heading="Armies">Armies</h2>
<p>Battles in Officer's Chess are fought between Armies, which are made of a number of Units. The scenario you choose to play will decide the War Chest each player has to spend on Hiring units to their army.</p>
<p>A Player may hire as many Units as they wish so long for a given battle, as long as the Cost of those Units doesn't exceed their War Chest. </p>
<h3 data-heading="Army Building Phases">Army Building Phases</h3>
<p>After choosing a Scenario and finding out how much Gold each player has to hire Units, their Armies are built in three phases: Hiring, Scouting, and Outfitting.</p>
<p>In the Hiring phase, each player builds their Army as they see fit, hiring Units in any Class the scenario allows for, equipping them with any Weapons and Items the scenario allows. </p>
<p>In the Scouting phase, the players then share the Classes that they are bringing to battle with each other. Inventory is NOT shared, only the types of Classes. </p>
<p>In the Outfitting phase each player may change the Inventory of their Units however they so choose. They may NOT change the Class of those Units, nor hire/fire Units they chose in the Hiring phase. </p>
<h2 data-heading="Deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>The scenario will define locations, or Deployment Zones, where the Attacker and Defender are able to deploy their units at the start of the match. It will also define who is to deploy first. </p>
<p>The first player to deploy will place all of their Units into their Deployment Zone. Once that player had decided the starting locations of their Units, the other player will deploy their units to their Deployment Zone. The first player cannot adjust their deployments after the second player begins theirs. </p>
<h1 data-heading="Gameplay">Gameplay</h1>
<h2 data-heading="Rounds">Rounds</h2>
<p>Players alternate choosing a Unit they control and activating a unit. When a Unit is activated it first can move, then take an Action.</p>
<p>The player that activates their last unit for the round first is the player that goes first on the next round.</p>
<h2 data-heading="Combat Turns">Combat Turns</h2>
<h3 data-heading="Move">Move</h3>
<p>All Classes have a base movement of 5 spaces. The <strong>Fast(X)</strong> and <strong>Slow(X)</strong> tags increase and decrease this amount respectively. Movement is also affected by Terrain. The following Terrain chart shows how much of a unit's movement is required to enter a space of that type. Units with certain tags (Armored, Cavalry, Flying) use their respective columns on the table, while all other units use the "Foot" column.</p>
<p>Single movement tiles: Plains, Sand, Buildings, Ruins, Floors, Stairs, Bridge, Village Gate, Castle Gate. </p>

<h3 data-heading="Actions">Actions</h3>
<h4 data-heading="Attack">Attack</h4>
<p>A Unit can attack a Target if the Target is within the Range of the Unit's weapon. The attack process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm the Target is in range of the Unit's Weapon.</li>
<li>Roll 1d20, if the number is under the Unit's Skill value, the Unit has hit the Target. 
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Inaccurate(X)</strong> tag reduces a Unit's Skill when make this roll.</li>
<li>On the roll of a 1 on the die, the Unit has gotten a critical hit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a Unit hits a Target, Damage is calculated and dealt to the Target.
<ul>
<li>Damage is equal to <code>Unit's Strength + Weapon Might</code></li>
<li>Check the Damage Type of the Attacker's Weapon. For Martial damage, the Damage is reduced by the Target's Defense. For Magic, it's reduced by Resistance.</li>
<li>Damage is doubled when the Unit scored a critical. This is applied after Defense and Resistance.</li>
<li>If the Target's hit points are reduced to 0 after taking damage, the Target is Routed. An Routed unit is removed from the map and unable to return to the battle.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the Unit has attacked, the Target gets a chance to counter attack. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the Unit and Target swapped.</li>
<li>Finally, the Unit with the higher Attack Speed value can make one more attack.
<ul>
<li>Attack Speed is equal to <code>Unit's Speed - Weapon Wt</code></li>
<li>in the case of a tie, neither Unit counter attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Special note: Staves cannot counter attack or follow up. </p>
<h5 data-heading="The Weapon Triangle">The Weapon Triangle</h5>
<p>The Weapon triangle represents how certain weapon types have combat advantages/disadvantages when used against certain other weapon types. There is a triangle for melee weapons as well as types of magic. When using an advantageous weapon against a Target, a Unit will deal one extra point of damage and when using a disadvantageous one, the Unit deals one less point of damage.</p>

<h4 data-heading="Use a Special Action">Use a Special Action</h4>
<p>Some tags give a Unit access to Special Actions, they can take on their turn. These actions don't require an accuracy roll when the Target is an allied Unit.</p>
<h4 data-heading="Scenario Actions">Scenario Actions</h4>
<p>Scenario Tags are tags that give units access to a Scenario Action. Scenario actions are special mechanics that are used in certain scenarios. Most of these tags can only be used on predefined tiles in a scenario. </p>
<h3 data-heading="Shifting">Shifting</h3>
<p>Taguel and Manakete classes are able to change their form using magic stones. When building a Unit with the Taguel or Manakete class, You will need to build using either the Transformed state (Taguel, Dragon respectively) or the Transformed+ state on your Army Sheet. In addition, you will need to mark down stats for the Unit's Normal state.</p>
<p>A Shifter Class shifts into it's transformed state when it is activated. The Shifter uses the transformed stat block for any actions it takes that turn. If the Unit took any action on it's turn, it transforms back into it's Normal state. Until the next Round, the Unit will exclusively use it's Normal state stats. </p>
