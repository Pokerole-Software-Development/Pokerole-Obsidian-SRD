Description: When this Pokemon is threatened, it calls thousands of allies to create
  an uncontrollable monster. The closer to the sea, the faster they arrive.
Effect: Only Wishiwashi can use this Ability. When this Pokemon reaches half or less
  of its HP its allies will arrive, when they do, replace your Pokemon for Wishiwashi
  School-Form at full HP. Increase its Rank to Pro. At the end of the battle restore
  Wishiwashi to its base form. (Healing/Fainting/Recalling prevents allies from arriving)
