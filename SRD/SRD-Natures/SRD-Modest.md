Confidence: 10
Description: When you are aware of your potential you don't need others to praise
  you for it. A modest nature knows the reward is the constant improvement of their
  abilities, not the acknowledging of others. They won't show off nor will they feel
  diminished when others display better capabilities. They'll do their best always
  and the only one who may judge the right or wrong of their ways is themselves.
Keywords: Measured, Self-Assured, Hard Worker
Name: Modest
