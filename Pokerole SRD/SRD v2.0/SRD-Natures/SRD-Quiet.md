Description: Life is what happens around those with a Quiet nature. They often take
  a passive stance over the circumstances around them. Strong thoughts or opinions
  they have will rarely be expressed, so they are not the greatest at social interactions.
  They may be afraid to make a mistake or consider it a hassle to take action. When
  they manage to get the attention of others they rarely know what to do with themselves.
Keywords: Silent, Reserved, Espectator
