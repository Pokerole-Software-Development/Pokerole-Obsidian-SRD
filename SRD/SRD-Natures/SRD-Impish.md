Confidence: 7
Description: Free spirits hungry for enjoyment and fun at the expense of others. They
  carry themselves with a light heart but you can also see a smug smirk on their faces.
  Playful, irreverent and agile of mind, they dislike routine and chores. They are
  the kind to circle around a problem as a head-on confrontation will stress them.
  They also want a little validation from others so they'll get attention as the pranksters
  of the group.
Keywords: Mischievous, Witty, Playful
Name: Impish
Nature: Impish (7)
