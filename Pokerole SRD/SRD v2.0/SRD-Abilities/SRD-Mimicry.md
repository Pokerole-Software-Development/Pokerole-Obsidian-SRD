Description: This Pokemon's body is perfect for camouflaging in the ground. It can
  sometimes get lost but you will find it if some unfortunate victim steps on it.
Effect: If there is a Terrain Move active (i.e. Electric Terrain, Psyichic Terrain
  etc.) Change this Pokemon's main type to match the active Terrain. Restore its original
  main type if the terrain effects end.
Name: Mimicry
