Confidence: 5
Description: Those with this nature will often ponder their options according to the
  level of risk. If the benefit is substantial but the risk is too great they will
  prefer an option less rewarding but also less risky. They may take some time to
  warm up to strangers and will always be alert to their surroundings. Keeping a situation
  under control is important for them, not being in control makes them anxious and
  stressed. If things get out of hand they might run away to fight another day.
Keywords: Analytic, Skeptical, Withdrawn
